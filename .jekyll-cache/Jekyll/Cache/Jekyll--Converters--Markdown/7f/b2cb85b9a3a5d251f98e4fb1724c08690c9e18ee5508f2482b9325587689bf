<p>ComputEEL/MatSci is a Materials Science-dedicated computational group located at the Materials Engineering Department (Demar, Depto. de Engenharia de Materiais) of the Lorena School of Engineering (EEL, Escola de Engenharia de Lorena), part of University of São Paulo (USP, Universidade de São Paulo). It started in 2017 as a computational support group for experimentally-driven research groups working on superconductivity at the department, but has since grown to be a fully functional and independent research lab working on several areas of Materials Physics, such as superconductivity, magnetism, and thermodynamics. The focus of ComputEEL/MatSci is on ab-initio electronic-structure DFT calculations, thermodynamic modelling using the CALPHAD method and simulation of thermal properties of alloys and intermetallic compounds.</p>
