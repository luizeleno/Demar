<p>Demar is receiving, for a period of four months, <strong>Prof. Dr. Milton Torikachvili,</strong> from San Diego State University (SDSU). Professor Torikachvili specializes in the so-called <strong>Extreme Physics,</strong> which consists in studying the physical properties of superconducting and magnetic materials subjected to extremely high pressures.</p>

<p>Torikachvili will conduct research with the group of new superconducting materials coordinated by <a href="/en/docentes/antonio-jefferson-da-silva-machado.html">Prof. Dr. Antonio Jefferson da Silva Machado</a>. In this project, topological superconductors discovered in Lorena will be evaluated for their properties in very high pressure regimes above 10 GPa. (Fapesp 2019 / 17878-5). The visiting researcher has an h-index of 37 with more than 150 papers published in extremely important journals in the field of Condensed Matter Physics.  ‚Äú<em>Torikachvili will certainly make a huge contribution to the group</em>‚Äù says Prof. Jefferson Machado.</p>

<p>The researcher did his master‚Äôs and doctorate at Unicamp under the guidance of <a href=""> </a> in the period between 1979 and 1981. His Post-Doctorate was held at the University of California at San Diego UCSD (under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Brian Maple) where he worked as a researcher until 1987. In 1987 Prof. Milton took up a teaching position at San Diego State University SDSU, where he remains to this day.</p>
