DEMAR-USP, as a department of the University of São Paulo, has always been and will be guided by excellence in its activities, in the unending search for quality and integration of teaching, research and extension activities. These values ​​that accompany USP are, in this case, amalgamated with a solid tradition of research and innovation founded more than 40 years ago with the Niobium Project.
