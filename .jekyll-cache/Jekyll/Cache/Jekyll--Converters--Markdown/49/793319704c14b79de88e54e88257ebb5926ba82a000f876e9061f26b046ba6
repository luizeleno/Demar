<p>It is with great pleasure that we inform that <a href="http://www.creasp.org.br/" target="\_blank">CREA-SP</a> (Regional Engineering and Agronomy Council - S√£o Paulo) approved the registration of the <strong>Engineering Physics</strong> course at the meeting of its Electric Engineering Chamber on 03/29/2019.</p>

<p>Following [CREA-SP]‚Äôs previous internal opinion (2002), the registration was done as <strong>‚ÄúControl and Automation Engineering‚Äù.</strong></p>

<p>This was a great success after we entered the process on 1/5/2018 (almost 16 months). Constant contacts and provisions were required. We thank all those who assisted with the progress of the request.</p>

<p><em>The Coordination of the Physical Engineering course.</em></p>
