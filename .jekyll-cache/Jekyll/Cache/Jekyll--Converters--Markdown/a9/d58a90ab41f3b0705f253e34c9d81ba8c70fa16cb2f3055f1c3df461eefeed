<p>It is with great pleasure that I inform that the EEL-USP Engineering Physics course  was the only one to receive 5 stars in the evaluation of the <strong>Guia da Faculdade</strong> of the <em>O Estado de São Paulo</em> news agency. According to this criterion, therefore, we can consider that the EEL-USP Engineering Physics course is the best in the country in this type of bachelor’s degree. This was a success for everyone: teachers, students and staff. Congratulations to all!</p>
