<p class="lead">Demar to host Superconductivity Expert</p>

<p class="small"><em>by Simone Colombo - Press Officer</em></p>

<p>Starting today, Demar will host Prof. Dr. John Neumeier, from the Montana State University - USA for a period of 6 months. The purpose of his stay is to continue a collaboration that spans over a decade with researchers from the superconductivity group of the Department of Materials Engineering at EEL (DEMAR).</p>

<p>Dr. Neumeier‚Äôs fields of scientific interest involve Condensed Matter Physics, Thermodynamics, Low Temperature Physics, and Single Crystal Growth. Dr. Neumeier is one of the leading experts in very high resolution thermal expansion measurements using quartz capacitive cells <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2884193">[J. J. Neumeier et al., Rev. Scient. Instrum. 79, 033903 (2008)]</a>.</p>

<p>In Lorena, the researcher intends to implement the Thermal Expansion technique at DEMAR‚Äôs Low Temperature Laboratory. He will develop the project named ‚Äú Crystal Structure of Niobium and the Anisotropy of its Superconducting Properties‚Äù which will be funded by FAPESP (Proc. 2019 / 12798-3) under the responsibility of <a href="/Demar"> </a>. In addition, during his stay at our department, the scientist will give some lectures about his recent research and will hold several meetings with researchers and  Scientific Initiation and Graduate students from the superconductivity group.</p>
