<p>With great sadness we communicate the death of Prof. Dr. Viktor Pastoukhov, Professor at the School of Engineering of Lorena (EEL) at USP.</p>

<p>Prof. Viktor was born in Samara (Russia) and lived in Brazil for 30 years.  His area of â€‹â€‹expertise was Solid Mechanics. At EEL, he taught postgraduate courses in Materials Engineering as a visiting professor from 1995 to 1996. He joined the faculty of USP in 2013. During the time he was with us, in addition to dedicating himself to research and teaching, he served as Head of the Materials Engineering Department and as Vice-Mayor of the USP Campus in Lorena.</p>

<p>To friends and family, our solidarity for this great loss for all of us.</p>
