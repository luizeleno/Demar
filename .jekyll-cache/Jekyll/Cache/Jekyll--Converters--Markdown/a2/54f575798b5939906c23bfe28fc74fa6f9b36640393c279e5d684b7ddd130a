<p>Professor at the University of São Paulo (USP) - Escola de Engenharia de Lorena. He got his background in Chemical Engineering from the Faculdade de Engenharia Química de Lorena - Faenquil 1988), a Master’s degree Materials Science and Engineering from the Faenquil (1992), a PhD at the same University in Materials Science and Engineering 2000. Visiting Professor at University of the California at Irvine (UCI) in the period between 2008 and 2010 with Prof. Dr. Zachary Fisk where he had opportunity of joined with Zach’s group for developed  new intermetallic superconductors Materials. His expertise area is concentrated in developing new superconductor materials with new quantum properties. The main topic of  interest is in develop new superconductors materials which can exhibit multband behavior, topological effects, non-centrosymmetric superconductors.</p>
