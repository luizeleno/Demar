<p>DEMAR received a visit from students from the Introduction to Materials Science (ICMat) class of the Biochemical Engineering course on 6/29. Prof. Hugo Sandim prepared five different experiments on the topics taught in the classroom.</p>

<p>In addition to allowing students from other EEL courses the possibility of knowing the operation of the processing and characterization equipment installed here, it gives ICMat students the chance to get to know Area 2 of EEL, its existing research infrastructure and a little more about the courses under our responsibility.</p>
