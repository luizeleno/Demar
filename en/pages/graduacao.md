Forms an engineer with profile to work in the area of ​​research and development of materials with technological application with inter and multidisciplinary vision of the traditional areas of Materials Engineering: Metallurgy, Ceramics, Polymers and Composites. Materials engineers study the relationship between material structure, properties, and performance to obtain new applications or improve the quality of existing materials. From the car to the kitchen utensils, from the cell phone to the fabrics of the clothes, practically everything has the intervention of a professional of materials engineering. Material engineers operate in a variety of industrial sectors: metal-mechanics, metallurgical and steel industries, plastics processing industries, automotive industries, ceramic tile and tile manufacturing industries, textile and synthetic fiber manufacturing industries, aeronautical industry and electro-electronic sector. The Materials Engineer will also be able to research, technological development and leadership roles in the introduction of new technologies, processes and products in the industrial segment.
