<p>The first Meeting - Technological Frontiers in Engineering took place on March 14 and 15, 2018 in the Department of Materials Engineering (DEMAR) of EEL, under the coordination of Prof. Dr. Fábio Herbst Florenzano. The organizing committee had members from all departments of the School, thinking of the EEL-USP as an emerging center, and in recent years received new teachers with different skills in the areas of knowledge attached to the Departments of Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, Physics, Environmental, Production and Materials. We highlight the positive aspects of the first event, attended by undergraduates, post-graduates and teachers from the different departments of the EEL during the cycle of lectures given by the invited researchers.</p>
