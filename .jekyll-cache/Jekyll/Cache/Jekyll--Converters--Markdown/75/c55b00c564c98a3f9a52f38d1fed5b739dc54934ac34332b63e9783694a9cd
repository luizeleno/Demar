<p>Rosa Ana Conte, physicist, graduated in Physics at Gleb Wataghin Physics Institute, University of Campinas, Campinas, SP in 1977, where she also received her master degree in Solid State Physics in 1984. Her PhD was in Science and Engineering Materials at Federal University of São Carlos, SP, in a joint work with Université Claude Bernard Lyon I, Lyon, France, in 1995. She accomplished her two post doctorates at Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, on techniques of spectrochemical analysis and chemical process control of materials obtained from biomass and residues, in 1999 and 2005, respectively. Since 1978 she is a senior researcher of the Materials Engineering Dept. of Lorena School of Engineering-EEL of University of São Paulo-USP, SP. She was an effective researcher of the Refractory Materials Program from 1978 to 1990, acting on the development of quality control (inorganic and interstitial impurities) and refining process (metal – gas interaction) protocols for metallic niobium at pilot and industrial scale, extending the protocols for other special metals and alloys. From 2006 to now she is engaged in the research line on Total Integration of Renewable and Fossil Energies to develop devices based on high performance materials for sustainable energy systems. She got 5 awards on researches on special metals and materials from solid residues.</p>
